				<h3>About</h3>
				<p class="txt-lg">Developer // Composer // Artist</p>
				<p>You're likely here for that last one. My art can be found in a variety of places:</p>
				<app-icons></app-icons>
				<p>Here, however, you can find galleries for full-resolution/alternative versions for artwork that are not available on the above sites. If you wish to support my art (or my other work), please consider buying a print from my Redbubble! Ko-Fi coming soon.</p>

					<span>Home site: <a href="http://lightling.xyz/">lightling.xyz</a></span><br/>
				</p>
				<p>I make music too! Consider supporting me by buying my music at <a href="https://lightling.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>.</p>
				<p>Music and art are hobbies (for me, that is). My main field of work is in game development. I'm currently a full-time student. I may periodically be inactive with art/music to work on projects or schoolwork. I may eventually set up Patreon for my development work, and I do have stuff available as PWYW on <a href="https://goldenwere.itch.io/">itch.io</a>.</p>
